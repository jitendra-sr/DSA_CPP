# Basic Approach for Sliding Window

    1. First find the solution by generating all subarray in O(N^2).
    2. Add best checks to prune the nested loop.
    3. Finally analyse how window can be used instead of outer loop and keep or modify the inner loop and checks.


# Typically sliding window technique takes O(2N) ie. Two passes.
To reduce it to O(N), we can use if condition instead of inner while loop with these techniques:

    1. store indexes and whenever inner condition not satisfies, directly jump left pointer to its correct place.

    2. keep size of window constant to previous correct max (or min) size and shift left pointer on each step.
    Start increaing it when it follow inner condition, till then before updating the answer check if window is correct or not.

Note: These optimizations are mainly usedful when we have to maximize something not minimize and counting.

|| SELECTION OF THE TYPE OF BINARY SEARCH TO APPLY ||

1. st<=end | st=mid+1 | end=mid-1
# When the stopping condition (at mid) is specific and you are sure that
if answer can be find it would definitely at mid, then you don't have to
shrink the search space till main condition (st<=end) holds.

2. st<end | st=mid+1 | end=mid
# When you don't know whether the answer can be lie on stopping condition
or the stopping condition is not specific, then you have to shrink the
search space till main condition (st<end) holds and then reach a point
(most likely st) where there is a possibility of getting result.


|| FINDING INDEX OF MATRIX ||

1. If i,j and R,C are given then ind=C*i+j  -> 2D to Linear
2. if ind then i=ind/C and j=ind%C  -> Linear to 2D

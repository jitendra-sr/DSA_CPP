Minimum Spanning Tree

1. MST of a graph(N,E) is defined as a minimum cost (or weight) tree having N nodes and N-1 edges
2. All nodes should be reachable by each other
3. As it is a tree therefore there should be no cycle

Algorithms to find MST
1. Prim -> Heap based, good for Dense graphs (E close to VÂ²).              O(E log V)
2. Kruskal -> Disjoint-Set based, good for Sparse graphs (E close to V).   O(E log E)

Both algorithms are Greedy.
